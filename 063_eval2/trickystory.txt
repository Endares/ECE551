Once upon a time, in a very _place_, there was a _character_ known for being _adjective_. 
One day, they encountered _character2_, and the two were caught in a _event_.
The _character_ had to use all their _skill_ to survive, while _character2_ showed their true _adjective2_ side.
It was a _emotion_ battle, and only one of them could survive.
Evidence of the first murder case are _11037a_, _11037a_ and _11037a_. Both _1_ and _2_ are useful in the Class Trial. 
The third murder case is a _-1_.
